# SAMP-Car-Tuning-Menu
Customize every car, anywhere with the command /tune.
Based on the car tuning menu?1.1 menu by Rsts [Lucas].

New features:

1. Select Add sound for:
Respraying;
Part installation.
2.?fixed issues.
Uranus body parts;
Mourning Roof Scoops;
Slamin front bumper for Slamvan.
All elements can be added to any vehicle as long as they're compatible.
With this update, I am pleased to say that there are no more known bug-scripts from earlier versions.

There is a problem with the client: Dialog is fixed in the center of the screen making the player tune the car almost blind.

What does this script do? Basically, this script allows you to customize any car you want.
Vehicle List: Just Open Pwn and Find Line Number 135. Add Vehicle ID there.
All the IDs for ground vehicles are present there. Other vehicles can be added, but tuning them can cause the game to crash.
The command /tune can only be used in a vehicle.

Restrictions:
1. Do not try to add a plane or a boat. Servers will crash if you try them to upgrade.
2. Special vehicles that can be added They can be installed only with hydraulic bass boost, wheels, paint and nitrous.


Warning:
You can modify or optimize this script the way you like it for your own server. But you are not allowed to release it under your name! Please give some respect and give credit as they are!

Version: 2.2 credit:
Rsts [Lucas]: He created the original script;
kaisersouse: He cleaned up indentations and permanent sub-issues.
Helion Prime (Me): I have rebuilt it entirely using dialogs instead of menus, added support for Transfender cars, added select sounds and did some other minor fixes (check above).

Version 2.3:
Updated the script and compiled it for open.mp
